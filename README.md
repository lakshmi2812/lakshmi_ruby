# lakshmi_ruby

This repository contains all the practice and self-learning exercises that I have worked on while learning Ruby.
Let me walk you through some folders in the repository.

'Project_Euler'
---------------
This folder contains solutions to some of the problems in Project Euler in ruby. The number in filename 
corresponds to the problem Number in Project Euler

'ruby_rspec'
------------
This folder contains some sample code in lib folder and test cases written using rspec in spec folder. 
TDD(Test Driven Development) has been followed. So, the sample test cases (in spec folder) were obtained from the internet. 
And then, the code was developed in lib folder to satisfy all the test cases in spec folder corresponding to each file
